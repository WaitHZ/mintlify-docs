title: "Self Implemented Servers"
---

In addition to selecting from existing publicly available MCP servers, we also implemented several local servers for the model to call.

<div align="center">

<table class="server-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Server</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th># Tools</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="server-name">sleep</td>
      <td class="server-description">Sometimes other servers raise some errors and the agent has to wait for a while.</td>
      <td><span class="tool-count">1</span></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="server-name">claim_done</td>
      <td class="server-description">Claim the task has been done.</td>
      <td><span class="tool-count">1</span></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="server-name">ai_webpage_summary</td>
      <td class="server-description">Driven by gpt-4.1-nano, extract the text from a webpage, and provide a summary of the webpage.</td>
      <td><span class="tool-count">1</span></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td><span class="tool-count">3</span></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="server-name">history_search</td>
      <td class="server-description">Enable the agent to search some contents in the interaction history, for instance, if some important information is lost after truncation, this tool will be useful.</td>
