## Instruction

I am a doctoral student in computer vision and will graduate next year. My career plan is to become a teacher in a university, so after graduating with my doctorate, I plan to find a professor who is engaged in the same research field to conduct postdoctoral work. More personal information about me can be obtained from personal_info.md ​​under the workspace. To ensure that this professor is active in the academic community, please help me find the three people who have published the most articles at CVPR 2025 and who meet my requirements. You need to tell me the names of these three people in the conversation. When querying paper statistics, please check the statistics of the corresponding conference from Paper Copilot https://papercopilot.com/
