## Instruction

Check my emails from the past day. If any mention the COML conference main-track camera-ready deadline, schedule a calendar reminder for me three hours before that deadline.

## Initial State

### Mails

There are 18 emails in the inbox. Here, we show one email as example:

<Accordion title="[COML 2025] Camera-ready instructions for accepted papers">
Dear **Dr. John Smith**,

**Congratulations on your accepted COML 2025 paper!**

The camera-ready submission is due on **2025-09-19 (11:59pm AoE)**. Please make sure to follow the steps below before this deadline to avoid your paper being withdrawn from COML. Detailed instructions are given below, with the main **mandatory actions** being the following:

1. At least one author must register for the conference with the **'Conference'** option checked in the registration form; *'Virtual Pass' alone is not sufficient* (see item 4 below).
2. At least one author needs to digitally sign the publication consent form (see item 5 below).
3. The presenting author needs to digitally sign the consent form (see item 5 below).
4. The corresponding author needs to sign the PMLR publication agreement form and upload it in PDF format together with the camera-ready submission (see item 6 below). *(Note: Maximum file sizes 20MB)*
5. Your camera-ready PDF should include a mandatory impact statement just before the bibliography (see the call for papers for instructions). Acknowledgments, the impact statement, and references are excluded from the 9-page limit.
6. Complete the camera-ready form on OpenReview (see items 7–10 below).

## Guidelines for Camera-Ready Submission

1. In the camera-ready version, you have an **extra page** to address reviewer comments, so the length limit of the paper body is **9 pages**, followed by any acknowledgements, the impact statement, and references.
2. You should include any appendices of the paper as part of the camera-ready PDF. There is **NO** camera-ready supplementary material of any kind — these will not be listed on PMLR nor on OpenReview. If you have code or other material you want readers to access, please upload it to a repository (e.g., GitHub) and include a link in your paper. We also encourage you to include the URL link to the code in the optional **"code url"** box on OpenReview — this will appear on both the OpenReview entry and PMLR.
3. You are allowed to change the author order on the camera-ready submission page, but **no author additions are allowed**. You may change the title and abstract slightly. If you wish to make a significant title change (e.g., suggested by the meta-reviewer), you must get permission from the program chairs.
4. **Register for the conference**: Go to [coml.cc](https://coml.cc) and click "Registration 2025". Log in (or create a profile). At least one author must register with the checkbox **'Conference'** ticked under 'Sessions'; selecting **'Virtual Pass' alone is NOT sufficient**.
5. At least one author must digitally sign the **COML 2025 Publishing Release form**, and the presenting author must sign the **COML 2025 Recording Release and License form**, both at:  
   [https://coml.cc/ConsentForm](https://coml.cc/ConsentForm)  
   *(You will need to log in to coml.cc to see your paper(s).)*
6. The **PMLR Publication Agreement form** (available at [http://proceedings.mlr.press/pmlr-license-agreement.pdf](http://proceedings.mlr.press/pmlr-license-agreement.pdf)) must be filled out and signed by the corresponding author and uploaded as part of the camera-ready submission.
7. Prepare your camera-ready version using the LaTeX style file from:  
   [https://media.coml.cc/Conferences/COML2025/Styles/coml2025.zip](https://media.coml.cc/Conferences/COML2025/Styles/coml2025.zip)  
   with the `\usepackage[accepted]{coml2025}` option.  
   **Mandatory:** Include an unnumbered **impact statement** section immediately before the bibliography. Optionally include an **acknowledgments** section. Both are excluded from the 9-page limit.
8. Check your PDF using the **COML Format Checker**:  
   [https://papercheck.coml.cc/papercheck.html](https://papercheck.coml.cc/papercheck.html)  
   Upload your paper to automatically detect violations. Fix all errors and re-upload until no violations remain. Upon success, you will receive a **5-letter submission code** — enter this in the OpenReview camera-ready form.
9. Upload required files via your OpenReview console. Enter your **title and abstract exactly as they appear in the paper**. Use TeX math sparingly; no custom macros or TeX commands. Ensure accents and special characters are entered using TeX commands (not direct Unicode characters).
10. **New this year**: You will be asked to enter a **"lay summary"** (also called "plain language summary") in the OpenReview form. See detailed guidelines and examples here:  
    [https://medium.com/@coml2025pc/lay-summaries-at-coml-2025-8d15e395b7f3](https://medium.com/@coml2025pc/lay-summaries-at-coml-2025-8d15e395b7f3)

## Critical Reminders (Do Not Wait Until the Last Day!)

- The main paper must contain **no more than 9 pages**. Acknowledgments, impact statement, references, and appendices must follow in the same PDF file.
- Enter author details exactly as in your `.tex` file (`example_paper.tex` in `coml2025_style.zip`). Ensure affiliations footnote renders correctly. Use:
  - `\printAffiliationsAndNotice{\comlEqualContribution}` if multiple authors made equal contributions.
  - `\printAffiliationsAndNotice{}` otherwise.
- Title and section headings should use **title case** (capitalize content words), not ALL CAPS.  
  Example: *"Deep Learning for Artificial Intelligence"* — not *"DEEP LEARNING FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE"*.  
  For guidance: [Capitalization Rules for Titles](https://grammar.yourdictionary.com/capitalization/rules-for-capitalization-in-titles.html)
- Carefully review your references. Replace arXiv citations with peer-reviewed versions where possible. Ensure proper capitalization in BibTeX using braces (e.g., `{Markov}`).
- Follow our **accessibility guidelines**:
  1. Review guidelines for color-blind and visually impaired readers.
  2. Ensure your bibliography is up-to-date (correct names and venues).
  3. Use inclusive and respectful language when referring to people.
- **No Type 3 font check** this year. You do not need TrueType fonts or to convert EPS to PNG. Prefer **vector graphics** (EPS/PDF) for plots and charts. Use bitmap graphics only when necessary.
- Abstracts should be a **single paragraph** of **4–6 sentences**.
- Citation font size must match the main text.
- Paper must be in **US Letter size** (not A4 or other).
- Full paper (including appendices) PDF ≤ **20 MB**.
- PMLR Publication Agreement PDF ≤ **10 MB**.
- Double-check that the **author order in OpenReview matches** your camera-ready PDF.
