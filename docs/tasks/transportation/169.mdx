## Instruction

I am staying at the Hilton Garden Inn Singapore and would like to travel to Changi Airport MRT station. I prefer not to use any mode of transport other than the MRT. Please design a route with the shortest walking distance. I remember that a friend is waiting for me at an MRT station along the way, where I need to meet her. Finally, please save all the stations passed in sequential order to a file named `routine.txt`, with one station per line.

Based on the distance matrix results, **Boon Keng MRT Station (NE9)** is the closest to your hotel with only 1.8 km walking distance (25 minutes walk). Now let me plan the MRT route from Boon Keng to Changi Airport.

From the Singapore MRT system, I know that:
- Boon Keng is on the North East Line (NE9)
- Changi Airport is on the East West Line (CG2)
- You'll need to transfer at Dhoby Ghaut (NE6/CC1/NS24) to connect to the East West Line

Let me get directions to confirm the route:

The directions show a route via Bendemeer, but this doesn't seem to be the most direct MRT route. Let me search for more specific MRT stations to understand the correct route. Based on my knowledge of Singapore's MRT system, the optimal route should be:

1. **Boon Keng (NE9)** - Starting station (1.8km walk from hotel)
2. **Little India (NE7/DT12)** - Transfer point
3. Take Downtown Line to **Expo (DT35/CG1)**
4. Transfer to East West Line
5. **Changi Airport (CG2)** - Final destination

Let me verify this route and get the complete list of stations:

Perfect! I've designed your MRT route with the shortest walking distance and saved all stations to the `routine.txt` file.

## Summary:

**Your optimal route from Hilton Garden Inn Singapore to Changi Airport MRT Station:**

1. **Walk 1.8km (25 minutes)** from your hotel to **Boon Keng MRT Station (NE9)** - this is the shortest walking distance to any MRT station from your location.

2. **MRT Journey:**
   - Take **North East Line** from Boon Keng to Little India (2 stops)
   - Transfer to **Downtown Line** at Little India
   - Take **Downtown Line** from Little India to Expo (23 stops)
   - Transfer to **East West Line** at Expo
   - Take **East West Line** from Expo to Changi Airport (1 stop)

3. **Potential meeting points with your friend:**
   - **Little India (NE7/DT12)** - Major interchange station, very convenient
   - **Expo (DT35/CG1)** - Another interchange station closer to the airport

4. **Total journey time:** Approximately 1 hour 15 minutes (including 25-minute walk to MRT)

The complete route with all 27 stations has been saved to `routine.txt` in your workspace, with one station per line as requested. The route uses only MRT as your preferred mode of transport and minimizes your initial walking distance.
