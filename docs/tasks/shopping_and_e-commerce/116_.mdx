## Instruction

I am the owner of a digital products store. Last week (January 7, 2024 - January 13, 2024), our store failed to promptly organize the business data, resulting in missing entries in the current ledger (in 'Account_Book.xlsx'). Please complete our store's ledger (directly modify 'Account_Book.xlsx') based on my remembered business records from last week. The transaction records from last week are presented in a structured 'memory.json' file.
