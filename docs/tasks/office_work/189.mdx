## Instruction

You are an academic administrator. Several new students who have changed majors will also be taking courses this semester. A new summary sheet has been created in the workspace to add them to the corresponding courses. Because they missed an assignment, you privately message these new students that their first assignment grade will be the same as their second, reminding them to complete the assignment diligently.
