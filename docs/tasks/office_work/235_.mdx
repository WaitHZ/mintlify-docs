## Instruction

Help me automatically update the two existing tables in the PURCHASE_INVOICE database with all the received receipts in my workspace. For receipts that are not fully paid, send an email to the relevant purchasing manager with the subject "Process Outstanding Invoices". The email body should include all the filenames that the manager still needs to process. Also, set a column description for outstanding_flag precisely as: "0=Paid, 1=Outstanding".

## Initial State

### Database

The database is rebuilt on each test; you can review the data construction process [here](https://github.com/hkust-nlp/mcpbench_dev/tree/finalpool_dev/tasks/finalpool/payable-invoice-checker/preprocess).
