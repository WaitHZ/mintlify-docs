## Instruction

I am a data analyst at an investment company. Please help me complete the market data conversion task by transforming the format of our existing Excel table. This is a market sales report for home appliances, providing sales statistics for household refrigerators, air conditioners, and household washing machines. You need to read `Household_Appliances.xlsx` in the workspace, which is currently a two-dimensional table where the information for the three types of home appliances is represented in separate columns. Please convert this table into a one-dimensional format (you can refer to the `Format_Example.xlsx`). Please create a new Excel table in the workspace for the processed data, named `Processed.xlsx`.
