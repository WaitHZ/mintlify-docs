## Instruction

A music streaming platform wants to accurately identify the 1940s pop singles with the most sustained popularity during their classic oldies promotion campaign, in order to replicate marketing strategies and plan themed programs. You should use the original sheet data`music-analysis/Billboard Pop Chart by Year` on my google drive to complete the following analysis:

1. Calculate the total number of consecutive weeks each song stayed on the chart (defined as the longest streak of non-empty/non-black weekly rankings).
2. Follow the format of the`music_analysis_result.xlsx` in the workspace, create one sheet for one year and fill them. There is a sample sheet for format reference (you should delete it). The final leaderboard in each sheet should be sorted in descending order firstly by the "Longest Consecutive Top 3 Weeks", secondly by "Song" (In lexicographical order), then by "Artist" (In lexicographical order).
