## Instruction

Your task is to check your email for homework2 submissions and grade on Canvas. Please download Python files from email attachments to local workspace and execute each Python file in terminal to check for errors. If the Python file is correct, give it a score of 10 in Canvas; otherwise, give it a score of 0. You could check the requirements of homework2 in `assignments/homework2.md`and students' ID in `student_canvas_ids.csv`. For students who submitted multiple times, use the latest submission.

## Initial State

### Local Workspace

<div className="file-tree">
<a href="https://github.com/hkust-nlp/mcpbench_dev/tree/finalpool_dev/tasks/finalpool/canvas-homework-grader-python/initial_workspace">workspace</a>/assignments/
├── homework1.md
└── homework2.md
</div>

### Mails

There are many emails in the inbox, only some of which are submissions for Homework 2; we show one here as an example.

<Accordion title="Homework 2 - Two Sum (CS101)">
Hi Professor Torres,

Here's my homework 2 submission for the two sum problem. I tried my best but I'm not sure if it's perfect.

I used the hash map approach we discussed in class. Hope it works!

Thanks,  
**Martha Watson**

```python
def twoSum(nums, target):
    num_map = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums)
        complement = target - num
        if complement in num_map:
            return [num_map[complement], i]
        num_map[num] = i
    return []

# Test the solution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
    target = 9
    result = twoSum(nums, target)
    print(f"Result: {result}")
    print("Tests completed!")
```
