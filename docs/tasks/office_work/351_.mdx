## Instruction

I would like to know Inter Milan's performance in the 2023 and 2025 Champions League finals. Please help me strictly fill in the three sheets in the inter_ucl_finals_23_25 spreadsheet on Google Sheets (the required data is listed in the table; please do not make any arbitrary changes to the column names or row names) based on the data from the official UEFA website. If any data is missing, mark it as "missing". After all the data pulling and verification are completed, directly write the read-only link of the completed Google Sheet into the sheet_url.txt file. When filling in the data, round numerical values to the nearest whole number unless otherwise specified. For “Avg age of starting lineup” and “Avg age of team”, compute the average age at the time of the game and round the result to one decimal place. Note that the values in the “StatsDifference” sheet are calculated by subtracting the 2023 data from the 2025 data for the same metrics.
