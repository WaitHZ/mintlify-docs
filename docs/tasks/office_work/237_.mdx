## Instruction

Please update the candidate information on the HR Record subpage of the Notion page according to the resumes in my workspace. All information must be filled out strictly according to the content in the resumes, without making any unauthorized modifications or adding/removing any words. Also, please delete the existing sample entries in the record table. At the same time, if the position applied for by the applicant is currently not open for recruitment, please send an email to the corresponding applicant using the following template information (including line breaks). Do not send the email by mistake:
