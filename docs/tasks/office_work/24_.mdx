## Instruction

Please help me read the files in my personal workspace, find all of my invoices, and extract the relevant information. From each invoice, extract the amount, date, and vendor. Then fill the `invoice_summary.csv` in my personal workspace.

Additionally, please look up the exchange rates for the dates on the invoices and calculate the total reimbursement amount in Chinese Yuan (RMB). If there is any tax, it should be included in the total. Finally, output the grand total in the format `{"total": xx}` to a file named `total_invoice.json` in my personal workspace.
