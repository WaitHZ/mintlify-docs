## Instruction

I am conducting research on a paper for an AI Conference. For each paper, please help me find the First Author's full name and the full name of the affiliation(s) the First Author belong to mentioned in paper. You need to fill them in the corresponding CSV sheet under my workspace and transform the finished CSV file to `paper_updated.xlsx`.
