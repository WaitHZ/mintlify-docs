## Instruction

I'm looking for a paper on arxiv related to agentic reasoning. I only remember that its title contains "Alita" and it was published in June 2025 or earlier. Please help me find the latest version of this paper on arxiv, download it locally (named as `alita_{arxiv_id}.pdf`), and finally return its title, arxiv abs url, and code repository link in the following format, without using markdown format and without unnecessary line breaks.

```
title: {title} arxiv_abs_url: {arxiv_abs_url} code_url: {code_url}
```

      "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled agents to\nautonomously perform complex, open-ended tasks. However, many existing\nframeworks depend heavily on manually predefined tools and workflows, which\nhinder their adaptability, scalability, and generalization across domains. In\nthis work, we introduce Alita--a generalist agent designed with the principle\nof \"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication,\" enabling scalable agentic\nreasoning through minimal predefinition and maximal self-evolution. For minimal\npredefinition, Alita is equipped with only one component for direct\nproblem-solving, making it much simpler and neater than previous approaches\nthat relied heavily on hand-crafted, elaborate tools and workflows. This clean\ndesign enhances its potential to generalize to challenging questions, without\nbeing limited by tools. For Maximal self-evolution, we enable the creativity of\nAlita by providing a suite of general-purpose components to autonomously\nconstruct, refine, and reuse external capabilities by generating task-related\nmodel context protocols (MCPs) from open source, which contributes to scalable\nagentic reasoning. Notably, Alita achieves 75.15% pass@1 and 87.27% pass@3\naccuracy, which is top-ranking among general-purpose agents, on the GAIA\nbenchmark validation dataset, 74.00% and 52.00% pass@1, respectively, on\nMathvista and PathVQA, outperforming many agent systems with far greater\ncomplexity.

First, using primary data we\nexamine the impact of asymmetric networks, built on rich relational information\non several spheres of living, on access to workfare employment in rural India.\nWe find that unidirectional relations, as opposed to reciprocal relations, and\nthe concentration of such unidirectional relations increase access to workfare\njobs. Further in-depth exploration provides evidence that patron-client\nrelations are responsible for this differential access to such employment for\nrural households. Complementary to our empirical exercises, we construct and\nanalyse a game-theoretical model supporting our findings.",

We identify the nature of `local' rural\ninstitutions based on primary data collected by ourselves (in 2013 and 2014).\nWe took 36 villages in the states of Maharashtra, Odisha and Uttar Pradesh - 12\nin each of these states - as the sites for our observation and data collection.\nWe quantify nature of institutions from data on the day-to-day interactions of\nhouseholds in the spheres of economy, society and politics. Our household\nsurvey shows that there is substantial variation in power structure across\nregions. We identified the presence of `local elites' in 22 villages out of 36\nsurveyed. We conducted a follow-up survey, called `elite survey', to get\ndetailed information about the identified elite households. We observe that\nlandlordism has considerably weakened, land has ceased to be the sole source of\npower and new power-centres have emerged. Despite these changes, caste,\nlandownership and patron-client relation continue to be three important pillars\nof rural power structure.",

The ground truth position for\nboth tracks are provided on each trajectory, which is obtained from the Global\nPosition System with an additional General ICP based point cloud refinement. To\nsimplify the evaluation procedure, we also provide the Python-API with a set of\nplace recognition metrics is proposed to quickly load our dataset and evaluate\nthe recognition performance against different methods.
