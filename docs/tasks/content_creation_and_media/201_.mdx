## Instruction

As a novice video content creator, I want to analyze the video style and patterns of the creator "MrBeast." I'd like to understand when his videos typically generate more traffic and what the optimal video length is.
Please analyze MrBeast's video publishing patterns from the beginning of 2024 to before July 1, 2025. Determine the day of the week with the most frequent video uploads, the average video length (excluding videos shorter than two minute), and the average number of days between uploads. Obtain the transcripts for the videos to understand their content.
Populate all results into the existing result.xlsx file in the workspace. In the two separate sheets, please fill in the detailed information for the videos from this period and the statistics I've requested, respectively. The specific content to be entered should follow the structure of the result.xlsx file. Do not create new worksheets without authorization. Please round all decimal numbers to two decimal places.
