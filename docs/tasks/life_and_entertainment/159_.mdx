## Instruction

I want to go on a vacation to Paris soon. Please help me create a two-day Paris travel itinerary based on the list of attractions in 'my_wishlist.txt'. My trip starts on July 28, 2025. I plan to start from Notre Dame Cathedral. On the first day, I will mainly focus on the eastern and southern areas of Paris, and on the second day, I will mainly focus on the western and central areas. Please help me plan the itinerary with a reasonable path for both days, save it as 'Paris_Itinerary.json', and strictly follow the format in 'format.json'.(If you reach the destination, "distance_to_next" is recorded as null, and opening hour is filled in with the opening hours of the day.)
