## Instruction

I want to go on a vacation to Paris soon. Please help me create a two-day Paris travel itinerary based on the list of attractions in 'my_wishlist.txt'. My trip starts on July 28, 2025. I plan to start from Notre Dame Cathedral. On the first day, I will mainly focus on the eastern and southern areas of Paris, and on the second day, I will mainly focus on the western and central areas. Please help me plan the itinerary with a reasonable path for both days, save it as 'Paris_Itinerary.json', and strictly follow the format in 'format.json'.(If you reach the destination, "distance_to_next" is recorded as null, and opening hour is filled in with the opening hours of the day.)

Construction started in 1163 and took nearly 200 years to complete. It has witnessed many key events in French history, including the coronation of Napoleon and Victor Hugo‚Äôs famous novel The Hunchback of Notre-Dame that helped save the cathedral.\n\nWhen I visited in the morning, I was honestly surprised by how crowded it already was. But despite the people, the stunning architecture completely mesmerized me. The details of the facade, the giant rose windows, and the impressive scale are unforgettable.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone interested in history, architecture, or photography!",

It can take a while, but it‚Äôs definitely worth it.\n\nConstruction started way back in 1163 and took nearly 200 years to finish. Walking inside feels like stepping back in time. One noteworthy thing is that the roof was built with wooden beams instead of stone, like many later cathedrals. That‚Äôs actually why the roof burned so fast during the big fire in 2019, it was mostly ancient wood, which caught fire quickly.\n\nIf you look up at the roof, you‚Äôll see those little stone creatures called gargoyles. They‚Äôre not just creepy decorations. Some of them work as water spouts to direct rain away from the walls, and others were thought to scare off evil spirits. Either way, they‚Äôre super cool and make great photos.\n\nOverall, I think Notre-Dame is a must-visit if you‚Äôre in Paris. It‚Äôs full of history, beauty, and a special spiritual feeling. Even after the fire, it‚Äôs still an amazing place to see. I‚Äôm definitely planning to go back once the restoration is fully finished so I can see it in all its glory again.",

If you want to snap a quick photo of it, you can take one of the paths on the side, but you are not allowed to stop, so you have to do it while walking.\n\nThe rest of the most famous works were not as crowded, so you could get to the front row quickly. Just don't expect to get a picture without other visitors in the frame.\n\nWe had a reservation for 13:30 and ended up entering around an hour later. If you are a quick walker, that might be enough time, but it sadly wasn't enough for us.\n\nThe giftshop and the bookstore closes at 18:30. The staff was very helpful.

What makes it really special is that the building itself used to be a huge train station, it was the Gare d‚ÄôOrsay, built around the early 1900s. Instead of tearing it down, they turned it into a museum, which means you get this amazing mix of old industrial architecture and art all in one place.\n\nInside, the museum is packed with incredible artworks, mostly from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. You‚Äôll find tons of famous Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings here, artists like Monet, Degas, Renoir, Van Gogh, and C√©zanne. If you love those bright, colorful paintings or want to get a feel for the art that changed the world, this is the spot.\n\nBesides paintings, the museum also has sculptures, decorative arts, and photography. It‚Äôs pretty manageable in size, so you don‚Äôt get overwhelmed like in some bigger museums.\n\nThe museum sits right on the left bank of the Seine, close to the Louvre and the charming Saint-Germain area. So, it‚Äôs easy to fit it into a day of exploring Paris.\n\nIt's recommended to visit here. :)",

The Orsay Museum houses some of the world's most treasured art pieces.\n\nFrom Monet, Gauguin, Manet, Renoior to Van Gogh and so many more.  Paintings and sculptures abound in the former train station.  A half-day should be the minimum amount of time spent in the great halls of the Orsay.  My last visit we elected to use a self-guided audio tour and enjoyed every step.\n\nThe Dance at the Moulin De La Galette by Renoir is my current favorite.  Degas' multi-texture sculpture Petite danseuse de quatorze ans is another favorite.\n\nThe Orsay is along the Seine near many other stops that I like to make when in the area.  Stroll along the river and take in the magazine stands and vendors.  Maybe a river tour starting from Pont Neuf.  With a little time left in your day the Luxembourg Gardens and the Shakespeare and Co Bookstore are easy additions to your afternoon trek.\n\nWhile I might prefer the Louvre or the Vatican overall as a museum...the Orsay has so many great works of art it should be included on your itinerary.  Definitely, something for everyone on this side of the Seine.",

If you know your plan, I highly recommend book the time slot in advance.\n\nI wish they limit or organise visitors a little more strictly.

As soon as you exit the metro (Line 1 ‚Äì Charles de Gaulle-√âtoile station), you‚Äôll pretty much see it right in front of you. Super easy to find, which was great because I didn‚Äôt want to waste time getting lost first thing in the morning.\n\nGetting there early was the best decision, barely any crowds and the lighting supposed to be great for photos (sadly it was a rainy day). If you‚Äôre into photography, this is the time to go. I managed to get some shots without people photobombing every picture.\n\nThe monument itself is huge and super detailed, way more impressive up close than I expected. You can walk around the base and really take in all the carvings and statues. I didn‚Äôt go up to the top this time but I‚Äôve heard the view is amazing, especially at sunrise or sunset.\n\nThere‚Äôs also a little memorial underneath with an eternal flame, which is really touching and gives a sense of the history behind the place. Cars are constantly driving around the circle.\n\nit‚Äôs a must-see if you‚Äôre in the city. Easy access, great photo ops, and just an iconic Paris experience. :)",

      "text": "*Paris Symbol, The World's Beloved Eiffel*\nThe Eiffel Tower is more than just a monument‚Äîit's the heart of Paris and one of the most recognizable structures in the world. Seeing it in person for the first time truly takes your breath away, whether it's by day with the blue sky as a backdrop or at night when it sparkles with thousands of lights. I had always seen photos and heard stories about it, but witnessing the Eiffel Tower with my own eyes was a completely new experience. The view from afar is impressive, but seeing it up close is entirely different. I could clearly see people climbing the stairs and others going up by elevator, and the intricate ironwork of the structure fascinated me. The tower's design is truly romantic and a masterpiece of architecture.\nA bit of history makes it even more fascinating: The Eiffel Tower was designed by the French engineer Gustave Eiffel and built for the 1889 Exposition Universelle (World's Fair), held to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution. At the time, it was the tallest structure in the world and a symbol of French engineering and innovation. Interestingly, many Parisians initially disliked the tower, calling it an eyesore‚Äîbut today, it's one of the most beloved landmarks on the planet.\nWhat made this visit even more special was celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary here. I felt deeply grateful that my wife and I could share this meaningful moment together at such an iconic place. I sincerely hope this beautiful memory stays with us forever.",

We went right up, maximizing our time at the top. After coming down, there was still plenty of time to capture some wonderful pictures from the ground, ensuring I had lasting memories.\nThis is definitely a place you must visit when in Paris!",

Can see the river and many of the other sites in Paris. For sure must see. Spend an evening from 7pm till 10:30 at the park with a view of the tower, picnic with some wine and great view.\nIf you are planning to do the picnic buy food, snacks at near by small grocery stores, buy wine there as well, much cheaper then buying from street vendors.\nAlso bring a blanket, grass is often wet, bring a cork/ bottle opener, some glasses and enjoy.",

I notice there's an issue with the itinerary I created - the Louvre Museum and Mus√©e de l'Orangerie are both closed on Tuesdays! Let me revise the itinerary to account for this and create a better plan:

Wait, I need to include all the attractions from your wishlist. Let me recalculate the distances and create a better itinerary that includes all 7 attractions across the two days, considering the opening hours. Since the Louvre and Mus√©e de l'Orangerie are closed on Tuesday, I'll need to adjust the plan.

Let me get the distance from Arc de Triomphe back to the Mus√©e d'Orsay area to plan a better route:
