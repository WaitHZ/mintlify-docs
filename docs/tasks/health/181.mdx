## Instruction

I am a male college student, and my body information is in `body.md`. I plan to create a fitness plan for the next 3 months. I am currently in the initial phase of fat loss. Please help me analyze whether my diet list (located in `cuisine.md`, all dishes are single servings) meets nutritional requirements (nutritional components of different raw materials are in `Nutrition.xlsx`, and the fitness diet table is in `health_guide.md`). Please ignore seasonings in the calculations. Additionally, some food raw materials do not have corresponding nutritional conversion rates in `Nutrition.xlsx`; please ignore these raw materials. If the nutritional composition does not meet the requirements, please point out which nutritional requirements have not been met or have exceeded the upper limit. Furthermore, please completely follow the `format.md` file to provide your analysis of food nutrition, and create a new file named `analysis.md`.
