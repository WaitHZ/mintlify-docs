## Instruction

Please scan the workspace folder, pick the model checkpoint with the highest eval_accuracy, then push the best model's folder to Hugging Face Hub as a model repo named `MyAwesomeModel-TestRepo`. 

Finalize the repo's `README.md` with the detailed evaluation results for all 15 benchmarks (keep three decimal places), you can refer to the current `README.md` under workspace.
