## Instruction

Could you please find the following datasets on Hugging Face, with their corresponding short source names in parentheses:

Team-ACE/ToolACE (toolace)
llamafactory/glaive_toolcall_en (glaive)
Salesforce/xlam-function-calling-60k (xlam)

Please refer to the `unified_format.md` file in the workspace to help me reformat the first 500 entries of these datasets into a unified format. Finally, merge them into a single large `unified_tool_call.jsonl` file and place it in the workspace directory.

If needed, you can use the `hf_token.txt` file to access an authentication token.
