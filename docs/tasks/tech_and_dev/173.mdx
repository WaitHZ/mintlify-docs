## Instruction

In recent days, the total number of repos on GitHub has reached 1B, which is a milestone worth commemorating! I hope you can help me collect information about some special repos to record this historic moment.

I need you to collect information about the following milestone repos:
- The 1st repo (repo ID: 1)
- The 1,000th repo (repo ID: 1000)
- The 1,000,000th repo (repo ID: 1000000)
- The 1,000,000,000th repo (repo ID: 1000000000)

Please save this information to a file named github_info.json. If information for a certain repo doesn't exist or is inaccessible, please skip that repo in the output json file.

Format:
```json
{
    "repo_id":{
        "key_0": "xxxx",
        "key_1": "xxxx"
    }
}
```

For each repo, please collect the following information (use the keys below in the JSON file):
- repo_name (repository name)
- owner (owner username)
- star_count (number of stars, integer value)
- fork_count (number of forks, integer value)
- creation_time (creation time, ISO 8601 format with Z suffix, accurate to seconds)
- description (description)
- language (primary programming language)
- repo_url (repository URL)
