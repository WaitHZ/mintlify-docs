## Instruction

Please find all files in the workspace that are related to the "Operating Systems Fundamentals" course and belong to Assignment 3. Based on the correspondence table between colleges and student IDs, rename these files uniformly as: Name-College-StudentID-OS-HW3. Please maintain the original capitalization and spacing of student names and colleges, and do not arbitrarily add or remove words. After completing the renaming, create a new directory called "os_hw3/" , and within this directory, place them into three new subdirectories: "C", "Rust", and "Python" respectively. Please delete all the original code files, including those outside of this course and those not related to the third assignment, after completing the organization process to keep the workspace clean.

## Initial State

### Local Workspace

There are more than 500 files in the workspace.
