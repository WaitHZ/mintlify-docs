## Instruction

I'm a third-year computer science student. I was absent from the last Compiler Principles course due to illness. I'd appreciate your assistance in studying the presentation `Compile.pptx`. I need to create a note (create a new file `NOTE.md`) to help me summarize the key points of the lecture. First, please summarize the definitions of functional and imperative symbol tables and their differences in insertion operations. Then, I see a lot of code in the presentation that represents the different modes of operation for each symbol table. Please help me put all of the origin code into my notes and provide explanations for each. Finally, please explain the homework assignments `HW.PDF` for this class.
