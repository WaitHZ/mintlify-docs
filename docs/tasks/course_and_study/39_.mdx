Application Materials Submission Guidelines

Folder Structure:

Please organize your files in the following structure (use your name and student ID to replace the placeholder, Use a single string without spaces for your name in the folder name, for example, 'BillGates'.):

```text
Application_Materials_[YourName]_[YourStudentID]/
├── 01_Personal_Information/
    ├── ID_Card.pdf
    ├── Photo.jpg
    └── Resume.pdf
├── 02_Academic_Materials/
    ├── Awards_Certificates/
    │   └── All_Awards_Certificates.pdf
    ├── Enrollment_Certificate.pdf
    └── Transcript.pdf
├── 03_Recommendation_Letters/
    ├── Recommendation_Letter_ProfessorName-1.pdf
    └── Recommendation_Letter_ProfessorName-2.pdf
└── 04_Supplementary_Materials/
    ├── Portfolio.pdf
    └── Project_Report.pdf
```

Naming Convention:

Use English file names (no special characters or spaces).

Ensure all documents are in PDF format (except for the photo, which can be JPG). Sort all award documents by date and merge them into a single PDF file, with one award per page. Finally, compress the entire folder into a ZIP file and send it as an attachment.

Once we receive your application, we will review it and notify you of the next steps. If you have any questions, feel free to reply to this email.

We look forward to receiving your application!

Best regards,
kaiming
