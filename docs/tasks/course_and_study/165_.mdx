## Instruction

There is a class schedule for the first semester of the 2025-26 academic year in the workspace. I want to take Natural Language Processing (自然语言处理) and Software Architecture (软件体系结构). In addition, I want to take one Ideological and Political Theory (B category，思政B) class on Monday and one General Education Core Curriculum class (通识教育核心课程) on Monday, and I hope that both of these have open-book exams instead of other forms of assessment. Please help me find these courses and output the results according to the format in reference_format.xlsx in the workspace. If there are multiple options for course selection, please save each option in a separate Excel file. To keep the workspace clean, please only keep the .xlsx files of each course selection scheme in the end, and delete any other unnecessary Excel files (including the reference format). The final .xlsx files should contain values in Chinese, but retain the original English headers.
