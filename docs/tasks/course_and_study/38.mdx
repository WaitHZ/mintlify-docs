## Instruction

I am the teaching assistant for the NLP course. The final presentation assignments from the students are now in my email. All the statistical data for this course is located in the Excel file named `nlp_statistics.xlsx` within the workspace. Please help me compile the statistics, identify who has not yet submitted this assignment, and send them an email. Please disregard any students who have already withdrawn from the course. The subject of the email should be "nlp-course-emergency," and the content must include the student's name and ID number to prevent it from being marked as spam.
