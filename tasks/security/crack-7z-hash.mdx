## Task Description

You need to extract a file called "secret_file.txt" from a password-protected 7z archive named "secrets.7z". The final solution should be saved as "solution.txt" containing the word found in "secret_file.txt".

## Prerequisites

- Linux environment
- 7zip utilities installed
- Hashcat or John the Ripper for password cracking
- Basic understanding of password attacks

## Instructions

### Step 1: Examine the Archive

```bash
# List contents of the archive (without extracting)
7z l secrets.7z

# Try to extract with a test password
7z x secrets.7z -p"test"
```

### Step 2: Extract Hash for Cracking

```bash
# Extract the hash from the 7z archive
7z2john secrets.7z > secrets.hash

# View the extracted hash
cat secrets.hash
```

### Step 3: Prepare Wordlist

Create a custom wordlist for the attack:

```bash
# Create a wordlist file
cat > wordlist.txt << 'EOF'
password
123456
admin
secret
test
hello
world
linux
ubuntu
debian
EOF
```

### Step 4: Crack the Password

Using John the Ripper:

```bash
# Run John the Ripper
john --wordlist=wordlist.txt secrets.hash

# Show cracked password
john --show secrets.hash
```

Alternative using Hashcat:

```bash
# Convert hash format for hashcat
john --format=7z --wordlist=wordlist.txt secrets.hash

# Or use hashcat directly
hashcat -m 11600 secrets.hash wordlist.txt
```

### Step 5: Extract the Archive

```bash
# Extract using the cracked password
7z x secrets.7z -p"[CRACKED_PASSWORD]"

# Verify extraction
ls -la
cat secret_file.txt
```

### Step 6: Create Solution File

```bash
# Create the solution file with the content from secret_file.txt
cp secret_file.txt solution.txt

# Verify the solution
cat solution.txt
```

## Expected Output

The `solution.txt` file should contain the secret word that was hidden in the encrypted archive.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Hash is successfully extracted from the 7z archive
- [ ] Password is cracked using available tools
- [ ] Archive is successfully extracted
- [ ] `secret_file.txt` is found and read
- [ ] `solution.txt` is created with the correct content

## Common Password Patterns

When creating wordlists, consider these common patterns:

- Dictionary words
- Common passwords (123456, password, admin)
- System-related terms (linux, ubuntu, server)
- Simple variations (password1, admin123)
- Keyboard patterns (qwerty, asdf)

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Hash Extraction Issues">
    - Ensure 7zip is properly installed
    - Check if john is configured for 7z format
    - Verify archive is not corrupted
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Password Cracking Failures">
    - Expand the wordlist with more variations
    - Try different attack modes (brute force, mask attack)
    - Check if the password uses special characters
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Extraction Problems">
    - Verify the cracked password is correct
    - Check file permissions
    - Ensure sufficient disk space
