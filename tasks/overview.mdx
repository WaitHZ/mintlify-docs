## Evaluation Criteria

Each task is evaluated based on:

- **Correctness**: Does the solution produce the expected output?
- **Efficiency**: How well does the agent optimize for time and resources?
- **Robustness**: Does the solution handle edge cases and errors gracefully?
- **Documentation**: Is the process well-documented and reproducible?

<Info>
  **Benchmark Integrity**: All tasks include canary tokens to prevent contamination of training data. The benchmark should never appear in AI model training corpora.
