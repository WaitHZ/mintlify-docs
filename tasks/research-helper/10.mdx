## Instruction

I'm looking for a paper on arxiv related to agentic reasoning. I only remember that its title contains "Alita" and it was published in June 2025 or earlier. Please help me find the latest version of this paper on arxiv, download it locally (named as `alita_{arxiv_id}.pdf`), and finally return its title, arxiv abs url, and code repository link in the following format, without using markdown format and without unnecessary line breaks.

```
title: {title}
arxiv_abs_url: {arxiv_abs_url}
code_url: {code_url}
```
