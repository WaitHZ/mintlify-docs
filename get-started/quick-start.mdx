# Quick Start Guide

Get started with MCPBench evaluation in just a few minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Docker (for containerized evaluation)
- Git (for cloning repositories)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mcpbench/mcpbench.git
cd mcpbench
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set Up Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install MCPBench
pip install -e .
```

## Running Your First Evaluation

### 1. Choose a Task

Browse our [task registry](/tasks) and select a task that matches your agent's capabilities.

### 2. Run Evaluation

```bash
# Example: Run a simple system administration task
mcpbench run --task build-linux-kernel --agent your-agent.py
```

### 3. View Results

Results are automatically generated and can be submitted to our leaderboard.

## Example Agent

Here's a simple example agent to get you started:

```python
import subprocess
import json

class SimpleAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "Simple Agent"
    
    def execute_task(self, task_description):
        """Execute a task based on its description"""
        # Parse task requirements
        requirements = self.parse_requirements(task_description)
        
        # Execute commands
        for command in requirements.get('commands', []):
            result = subprocess.run(
                command, 
                shell=True, 
                capture_output=True, 
                text=True
            )
            
            if result.returncode != 0:
                return {"success": False, "error": result.stderr}
        
        return {"success": True, "output": "Task completed successfully"}
    
    def parse_requirements(self, description):
        """Parse task requirements from description"""
        # Simple parsing logic - implement based on your needs
        return {"commands": ["echo 'Hello World'"]}

# Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent = SimpleAgent()
    result = agent.execute_task("Print hello world")
    print(json.dumps(result, indent=2))
```
