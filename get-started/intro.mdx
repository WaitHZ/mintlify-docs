# Introduction to MCPBench

MCPBench is a comprehensive benchmark suite designed to evaluate AI agents' capabilities in terminal environments. Our mission is to provide standardized, rigorous evaluation methods that help researchers and developers understand and improve AI agent performance across real-world terminal operations.

## What is MCPBench?

MCPBench (Model Control Protocol Benchmark) is a collection of 127 carefully curated tasks that test AI agents' abilities to:

- **Navigate Terminal Environments**: Execute commands, manage files, and interact with system tools
- **Solve Real-World Problems**: Handle tasks that mirror actual system administration, security, and development workflows
- **Demonstrate Reasoning**: Show logical thinking, error handling, and problem-solving capabilities
- **Adapt to Constraints**: Work within resource limits, time constraints, and specific requirements

## Why Terminal Evaluation Matters
